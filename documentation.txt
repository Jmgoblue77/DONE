Overview of website:
    - the website introduces you to a new method that will help you be productive. You get lots of info about the method - how to use
    it, how effective it is, etc... After registering and logging in, you can try the method for yourself by following the instructions
    and entering your to-dos/goals.

How to use the website:
    1. To get to the website, cd into finalproject and run flask 
    2. The home page is an introduction, you can go several different ways
        - you can learn more about to-dos vs goals with the first two links
        - three pictures/descriptions take you to different pages with more info about their respective topics
        - try now section, will redirect you to login/register before you can actually create goals/todos
        - download app now - only there for appearance at the moment, app does not exist... yet
    3. Upper nav-bar
        - DONE in the upper left takes you back to home page
        - about takes you to three info pages (same pages as big pictures)
        - try now allows you to register and log in
    4. Once you register and log in, you can create to-dos and goals under create in the upper nav-bar.
    5. For instructions on how to create to-dos/goals, see the first two links on the home page or the links when you hit
        create todo/goal.
    6. You can view your to-dos and goals under view in the upper nav-bar. This will bring you to a table of your to-dos/goals.
    7. You can remove to-dos and goals once you have finished them by checking them and then clicking remove.
    8. You can edit the plans in the table if the grammar is not perfect - I did not have time to run language anlysis. Next step is 
        to be able to save the changes. If this doesn't make the most sense now, once you create a plan and see the table, it will.
